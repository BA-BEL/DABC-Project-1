To determine quality we can used the imdb ratings against the films hosted on each streaming provider to compare 

PROFIT
We can also map out the ‘profit’ of the films available (not to be confused with the profit of the streaming platforms) to identify how many “successful” films each streaming service hosts. 

Split over over the 20 year period, we can see a sharp decline in overall film profits starting at around 2015. This can be directly correlated with the introduction of streaming services, highlighting that larger box office productions started taking a hit when consumers were given the option to watch from home. This is further proven by Netflix recording a higher profit from 2015 - 2020, as Netflix dominated the market with their ‘Original Content’

It may also highlight the change in peoples viewing preference from Films to TV Series.

Based on this Data, it’s fair to

VOLUMES AND QUALITY

Our team has retrieved, a total of 5325 movies from 2000-2023 that are available in Netflix, Stan and Amazon Prime Video. In terms of variety, Amazon and Netflix provider viewers in Australia with far more options, with a large focus on recent releases. Across the three platforms, 2223 movies we’re release between 2015 to 2019.

By comparing this volume with the imdb score rating for each film we can start to notice trends. While Amazon has saturated the market with options, it doesn’t necessarily equate to quality programming. Netflix and Stan both trend higher when it comes to overall voting scores, with Stan averaging higher overall for the 20 year period.

Netflix boasts 646 more available title to watch than Stan, while only having only a -0.2 rating difference in terms of quality (Stan 6.5, Netflix 6.3)

In this aspect, it’s fair to argue that Netflix provides the best options for consumers wanting a large amount of quality viewing. 








DIVERSITY OF LOCATION
By plotting the location of the films country of origin, we can determine how diverse the streaming platforms library is.

(Size of the circle determines the volume of films from that location, where intensity of color shows average ratings.)

Using the visuals we can see all three providers are US dominated. Amazon and Netflix boast a far broader range of countries than Stan does, but Stan makes up for this by having the higher quality films on average per country available. 

3.1. Overview of movies available from the source
	3.2. Distribution of genres, ratings and budget per group year(5 year increments)
	3.3. Comparison of movies across three streaming platforms: audience rating, runtime, country proudction, etc. 

4 main questions -
-Quality
-Genre
-Diversity of Country
-Success

For this analysis the following are defined as;
	Quality: measured by imdb vote score and imdb vote count
	Genre: as defined by imdb 
	Diversity of Country: measured by the count of movies create from different countries
	Success: measured by ‘Profit’ (revenue - budget)
