# DABC-Project-1

Project title: "Comparison of Films in 2000-22 that are available on Netflix, Stan and Amazon Prime Video"

Project Objectives:

1. Retrieve dataset for movies from 2000-2023 with information on their availability on three streaming platforms: Netflix, Amazon Prime Video and Stan.
2. Perform data clean-up, filter and formatting for a standardised master file.
3. Create at least 6-8 visualisation graphs for data analysis of the following:
	3.1. Overview of movies available from the source
	3.2. Distribution of genres, ratings and budget per group year(5 year increments)
	3.3. Comparison of movies across three streaming platforms: audience rating, runtime, country proudction, etc. 

Data Source: The Movie Database API, IMDB data files, and GeomapAPI.

Written Data Analysis

1. Our team has retrieved, a total of 5325 movies from 2000-2023 that are available in Netflix, Stan and Amazon Prime Video. There are 2223 movies that are available in the streaming platforms are from 2015 to 2019 while there only 396 movies from the early Y2K era. It may be a strategy of streaming platforms to target audiences with preference "trending" movies within the decade.

 Additionally, there is a significant decrease of available movies from 2020 onwards and it may be due to the pandemic restriction on movie production.

2. The graph for the Top 500 highest budgeted films with their IMDB ratings shows the genre distribution of movies. It is interesting to note that majority of genres have a budget less than 1 million in USD with rating score of 5 to 8. The movie genres in the highest end of budget spectrum with high ratings are Fantasy, Sci-fi and Adventure film categories (e.g. Justice League, Spiderman, The Hobbit). 

3. Using boxplot, it visualises the genre distribution of the top 100 rated movies available in the streaming platforms. Interestingly, in grouped year 2015-19, Drama and Comedy movies have the most outliers from both ends of IMDB ratings. The plots per year group shows several outliers of rating score from different genres and this may be due to the subjective preference and number of voters from the IMDB data file.

4. Using barplot, the figure shows comparison of movie genre across three different platforms: Netflix, Stan and Amazon Prime Video. This easily showcases the quality of available film categories which may be helpful for audiences to decide what streaming platform to use depending on their movie preference. For example, if Person A only prefers science-fiction movies, Stan has the most high rated movies in that genre.

5. Using line graph, the movie runtime in each streaming platform according to IMDB rating is varied across the digital platforms. In Netflix, the highest rated film has 150 minutes, while in Stan and Amazon Prime Video it's at 200 minutes. For a person who just wants to watch a short movie (less than 2 hours) with an average quality, the best option is to stream Netflix.
